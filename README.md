# pixi-omber-gltf2-vector
pixi-omber-gltf2-vector is a plugin for accelerated vector graphics on the [Pixi.js](http://www.pixijs.com) JavaScript graphics engine. Vector graphics are particularly useful for HTML5 games because it offers smaller file sizes than bitmaps for high resolution art that contains transparency. 

With the plugin, you can load vector art encoded as a 3d mesh in [glTF 2.0 format](https://www.khronos.org/gltf/) and then use the art in a game just like a normal Pixi.js sprite. Although the plugin is specifically designed to work with vector art created in the drawing program [Omber](https://www.wobastic.com/omber/), Omber has some support for loading SVG files and then resaving them out in glTF format.
